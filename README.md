# handwritten-digit-recognition-system
Handwritten digits recognition system using K-nearest neighbors, Multilayer Perceptron and Convolutional neural network

This repository will have a simple UI with 3 ways of predicting numbers. 

# K-nearest neighbors
We will implement with gaussian weight and sigma value = 2 with K = 7.

# Mutlilayer Perceptron
